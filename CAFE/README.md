## Lightweight LLM Related (`aithor2/embodied B1/`)

- `main.py`: Main logic entry for lightweight LLM, dynamically loaded and called by `main_with_depth.py`.
- `config.py`: Configuration file, stores API keys, model parameters, etc. (Do not leak your keys).
- `prompts.py`, `prompts_new.py`: Store LLM prompts, imported by the main program.
- `api.py`, `mab.py`, `world.py`, etc.: Implement LLM API wrappers, multi-armed bandit algorithms, world models, etc.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependency list for this submodule.

## Main Function

- The main entry is `aithor2/main_with_depth.py`, responsible for overall scheduling.
- This main program dynamically loads `aithor2/embodied B1/main.py` and calls its core classes such as `ThreeLLMSystemV2` for understanding and task planning.
- Prompts and configuration for the lightweight LLM are in `aithor2/embodied B1/prompts.py` and `aithor2/embodied B1/config.py`.

## Environment Setup

- Install main dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r aithor2/requirements.txt
  ```
- Install lightweight LLM submodule dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r aithor2/embodied B1/requirements.txt
  ```

## Other Notes

- `.venv` and `.venv_ai2thor` are virtual environment folders. Keep or remove them as needed.
- Do not expose your personal API keys in config.py or other files.
